#### Can create a file's groups and open files with default system application

To run application as a mac user:
1. download Opener-0.1.0.dmg
2. install it

I don't have ios developer status, so I cannot sign this application.

3. In the Finder  on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.
4. Don’t use Launchpad to do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the shortcut menu.
5. Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.
6. Click Open.

The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.

## Run project
```
npm run electron:serve 
```

### Build app
```
npm run electron:build
```
